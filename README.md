A smart city aims to provide a better quality of government service and citizen welfare. When it comes to the latter, women safety is one important concern of citizen welfare.
The increasing number of women threats like harassment ,molestation in public spaces has become a huge concern for the government.
The fear of violence can prevent women from pursuing education, working or exercising their political rights and voice which is a very bad indicator for any countryâ€™s development.
A total of 3,38,059 cases have been reported under violence against women in India in 2016 and a baseline study revealed that in New Delhi, 92% of women had experienced some form of sexual violence in public spaces during their lifetime.
Violence against girls and women is recognized as a major obstacle to the enjoyment of a whole range of human rights and to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development-5
